## 1. User Flow

This is a survey site that user is able to create new surveys while other users should have the ability to fill out those surveys. This provides full CRUD functioanlities and authentication.

1. A user is able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database.
2. A user is able to fill out and submit surveys. 
3. Survey results are submitted to the database. 
4. A user is able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
5. A user has their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.
6. A user is able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys.
7. A user is able to take a survey and select their answers on slider bar.
8. A user is able to view survey responses based on firestore data : total number of reponses, average answer. Result page also provide a gragh that visualizes data.

### Parking lot

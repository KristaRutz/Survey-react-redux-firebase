## 1. User Flow

This is a survey site that user is able to create new surveys while other users should have the ability to fill out those surveys.

1. A user is able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database.
2. A user is able to fill out and submit surveys. 
3. Survey results are submitted to the database. 
4. A user is able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
5. A user has their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.
6. A user is able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys.

Try using a library like D3 to visualize data from surveys. This is only recommended if you have time to spare, interest in data visualization, and are doing a week-long project.

### Parking lot 
1. A user has their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.

4. Dynamically shows input from sliders. i.e. As you move the bar it tells you what the value is
5. Display indicates whether a user has already taken a survey
6. CSS styling
7. Shows different types of data from surveys, so maybe median value or standard deviations from the mean etc.

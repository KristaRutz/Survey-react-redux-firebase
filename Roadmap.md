## Roadmap

- a grading system (?)
- dashboard for surveys created by a logged-in user
- tie surveys to user IDs
- authorization for creating surveys/taking surveys
- different length of surveys/types of questions
- indicates a user is signed in
- Make the buttons look nice


1. A user has their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.
2. Visualize data from surveys 
3. User can choose from multiple different form types
4. Dynamically shows input from sliders. i.e. As you move the bar it tells you what the value is
5. Display indicates whether a user has already taken a survey
6. CSS styling - Last
7. Shows different types of data from surveys, so maybe median value or standard deviations from the mean etc.

   - Limit create Survey to Users. Designate which functionality is for signed in users
2. Visualize Data
